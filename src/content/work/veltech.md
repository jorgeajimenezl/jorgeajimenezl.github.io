Developed and maintained cloud-native solutions on Microsoft Azure for internal enterprise projects supporting Zurich Insurance Group, designing and implementing system integrations between internal platforms using REST APIs, event-driven architectures, and secure messaging patterns. In this work, I used Azure services such as App Services, Functions, Service Bus, Storage, and Azure DevOps to support CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployments.

I architected and deployed a high-performance REST API for the Streaming Cuba event system, enabling real-time content distribution. I optimized SQL queries that reduced latency by 30% and contributed to DevOps efforts by automating CI/CD pipelines and managing cloud deployments, which streamlined the entire development workflow.

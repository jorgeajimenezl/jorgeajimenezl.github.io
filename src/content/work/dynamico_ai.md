I engineered efficient backend solutions to optimize chat interactions with LLM models, significantly improving response times and system reliability. I also developed seamless integrations with multiple communication platforms—including MS Teams, Telegram, and Slack—expanding accessibility for end users. To ensure robustness and continuous improvement, I integrated monitoring and logging tools that enabled detailed analysis of model behavior and performance. Additionally, I designed and deployed scalable cloud-based microservices on Azure, delivering a resilient and production-ready infrastructure.
